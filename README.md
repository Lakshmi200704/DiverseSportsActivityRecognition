# Diverse Sports Activity Recognition Using Custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Complex Athletic Movements

Objective and Target Audience

  The Diverse-Sport Action Recognition model will primarily benefit professionals in the sports, fitness, and
healthcare industries. Sports analytics companies, coaches, and trainers can leverage this technology to analyze
complex athletic movements across various disciplines, providing insights for performance optimization and injury
prevention. By automatically recognizing actions like running, kicking, or swinging, the model enables real-time
tracking of player performance, helping coaches offer more targeted feedback and design data-driven training
programs.

  Additionally, physical therapists and rehabilitation specialists can use the action recognition model to monitor
patient movements, ensuring exercises are performed correctly during recovery, thus aiding in faster and safer
rehabilitation. Sports broadcasters and media outlets could enhance their coverage by integrating real-time
movement analysis during live events, offering viewers detailed breakdowns of key moments. Finally, wearable tech
companies could embed this technology into their products to track a wide range of athletic activities with higher
accuracy, providing users with precise data on their performance. This solution brings value across multiple sectors
by automating action recognition, improving accuracy, and driving data-driven decision-making in sports and
health.

Problem Statement

  The Diverse-Sport Action Recognition solution aims to address the challenge of efficiently analyzing
and recognizing complex athletic movements across different sports disciplines. Currently, manual
observation or limited technology is used to track and evaluate athlete performance, which can be
time-consuming, prone to human error, and lacks real-time feedback. Coaches, trainers, and sports
analysts struggle to obtain precise, objective data on players' movements, while fitness enthusiasts
and rehabilitation patients may not receive timely corrections to their exercise form.
This solution uses a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to automatically classify
and recognize various sports actions, such as running, kicking, or swinging, from video or image
datasets. It can handle a diverse range of activities and provide real-time insights for performance
optimization, injury prevention, and rehabilitation tracking. By automating the recognition process, the
model aims to deliver precise and instant feedback, improving training effectiveness and decision-
making in sports, fitness, and healthcare contexts.

Proposed Solution

The Diverse-Sport Action Recognition solution utilizes deep learning and computer vision technologies to
automatically classify and recognize various sports activities. The core of the system is a custom-built
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to handle large datasets of images and videos depicting different
athletic movements, such as walking, running, kicking, and swinging. The CNN extracts spatial features from these
images using multiple convolutional layers and pooling techniques, followed by fully connected layers for
classification. The model is trained on a diverse dataset with actions categorized into subdirectories, with
preprocessing steps such as resizing and data augmentation to enhance performance.
The system is scalable, allowing the model architecture to be expanded for more complex datasets or video-based
inputs by incorporating deeper networks like ResNet or 3D CNNs. It also has the potential to integrate with pose
estimation tools to further refine the recognition of detailed body movements. Once trained, the model can be
deployed in real-time applications, including sports analytics, fitness tracking, and rehabilitation systems,
providing actionable insights for coaches, trainers, athletes, and healthcare professionals. This solution offers an
efficient and automated method for recognizing sports actions, enabling real-time analysis and performance
optimization.
